# Regression-Driven Stock Market Price Predictors Survey

## Introduction

This repository contains the research paper titled "Survey of Regression-Driven Stock Market Price Predictors," presented at the 2nd National Conference on Engineering Applications of Emerging Technology in association with the International Journal of Scientific Research in Science, Engineering, and Technology. The paper investigates various regression algorithms for stock market price prediction, focusing on their accuracy and performance metrics.

## Abstract

The research delves into the application of machine learning techniques, particularly regression algorithms, to predict stock market prices. It emphasizes the significance of factors such as company earnings, market competition, demand, and stability in making accurate predictions. The paper analyzes the performance of regression models, including Linear Regression, Robust Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression, using a dataset obtained from Kaggle. The study measures their accuracy based on metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2).

## Features

- Detailed analysis of Regression algorithms in stock market prediction
- Explanation of various performance metrics used in the analysis
- Implementation of Python and Scikit-learn for the regression models
- Insightful data representation through graphs and charts

## Results

The results showcase the efficacy of different regression models, as illustrated in the table below:

| Model  | MAE       | MSE       | RMSE     | R2 Square | Cross Validation |
|--------|-----------|-----------|----------|-----------|------------------|
| Linear | 3.845779  | 30.11601  | 5.487806 | 0.997035  | 0.925135         |
| Robust | 3.845779  | 30.11601  | 5.487806 | 0.997035  | 0.925135         |
| Ridge  | 6.633434  | 64.82109  | 8.051155 | 0.993619  | 0.925135         |
| Lasso  | 3.850596  | 30.12317  | 5.488458 | 0.997035  | 0.92513          |
